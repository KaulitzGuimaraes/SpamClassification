# SpamClassification

A machine learning project to classify messages as spam or not spam, helping to filter unwanted content efficiently.

## Features

- Uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze message content
- Implements classification algorithms to distinguish spam from legitimate messages
- Provides training and testing scripts for easy experimentation
- Includes evaluation metrics to assess model performance

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NLTK (or specify if you use another NLP library)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Prepare your dataset (example dataset provided or specify source).
2. Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

3. Test the model with sample messages:

```bash
python test.py
```

## Project Structure

- `train.py`: Script to train the spam classification model.
- `test.py`: Script to test the trained model on new messages.
- `data/`: Folder containing datasets (if any).
- `notebooks/`: Optional Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experiments.

## Results

Include accuracy, precision, recall, or any metrics here after running your model.
